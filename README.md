### Data Cleaning

The initial raw dataset, comprising 20 columns and 9995 rows, was thoughtfully prepared and provided for analysis. In the data preparation phase, three additional columns were introduced to enhance the dataset's analytical capabilities. Two of these new columns were designed to extract the relevant information regarding the month and year from the shipment day, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis across various months and years. The third additional column served the purpose of calculating the actual price of the product sales, augmenting the dataset's value and enabling a more profound understanding of revenue generation. 

As a result of these strategic data enhancements, the dataset was expanded to encompass 23 columns and continued to maintain its original 9995 rows. The meticulous data cleaning process was executed proficiently, ensuring the dataset remained free from missing data points and outliers, which could have potentially skewed the analytical outcomes. This attention to data quality further bolstered the dataset's reliability, making it an optimal foundation for conducting robust and accurate analytics. With the dataset now primed and enriched with pertinent information, it serves as a valuable resource for in-depth business analysis, providing critical insights to guide decision-making and drive future success in the US superstore market.
