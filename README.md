### Data Cleaning

The initial raw dataset, comprising 20 columns and 9995 rows, was thoughtfully prepared and provided for analysis. In the data preparation phase, three additional columns were introduced to enhance the dataset's analytical capabilities. Two of these new columns were designed to extract the relevant information regarding the month and year from the shipment day, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis across various months and years. The third additional column served the purpose of calculating the actual price of the product sales, augmenting the dataset's value and enabling a more profound understanding of revenue generation. 

As a result of these strategic data enhancements, the dataset was expanded to encompass 23 columns and continued to maintain its original 9995 rows. The meticulous data cleaning process was executed proficiently, ensuring the dataset remained free from missing data points and outliers, which could have potentially skewed the analytical outcomes. This attention to data quality further bolstered the dataset's reliability, making it an optimal foundation for conducting robust and accurate analytics. With the dataset now primed and enriched with pertinent information, it serves as a valuable resource for in-depth business analysis, providing critical insights to guide decision-making and drive future success in the US superstore market.

### Data analyzing using PIVOT TABLEs

From the meticulously cleaned and enriched dataset, I applied various data analysis techniques to extract pertinent pieces of information from various categories. By utilizing a pivot table, I strategically juxtaposed different categories against one another to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying insights hidden within the data. This analytical approach allowed me to explore relationships, patterns, and trends that might not have been immediately apparent through conventional means.

### Visualisation of insights

The meticulous data crossing and transformation process conducted through pivot tables has proven to be highly illuminating, as evidenced by the insightful visualizations presented below. Through these visual representations, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of crucial patterns and trends that profoundly impact decision-making. Specifically, the visualizations allow us to identify the categories that significantly contribute to revenue generation, discern the volume of goods sold across different segments,identify the regionional demands of the store products, pinpoint the states with the highest order frequencies, and highlight the segment and subcategories in greatest demand.




### Conclusion
These pertinent insights offer a wealth of information that can substantially guide and optimize the store's strategies for enhanced revenue generation. Armed with this data-driven knowledge, the store can proactively plan ahead, making informed decisions to capitalize on opportunities while avoiding potential pitfalls, all aimed at achieving sustained revenue growth and business success.
